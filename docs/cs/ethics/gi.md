The german "Gesellschaft fuer Infformatik" creates ethical stuff to follow.
These are my TLDR to do.

- Know what you are doing
- Know how to communicate what you are doing 
- Know the law you are moving in
- question yourself and your work
- Work for good working conditions 
- Participate in organisations who take over responsibility
- Teach and be taught about critical thinking
- When working in scientific facilitires, know about best scientific practisies
- Stand up for the protection of the "menschenwuerde" even, if lawsw are against it.
- Your work should benefit the local and global living condition in the long run
- Work with the people affected by your system
