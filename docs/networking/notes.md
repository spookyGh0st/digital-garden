## Random notes

unordered, unorganized and subjectiv

When implementing standards, follow them as strict as you can but be as free as you can when accepting them.
(for example never put 1 into the reserved ip header bit, but accept a package when it does)

Delegation of authorities, ip addressen are split by subnets.
There are no single ip addresses randomly assigned through the globe.
Router only have to know the information relevant to them.
Oh this Address has a 14 -> up to europe (incorrect).

modern tcp stacks will try to find the smallest maximum transmission unit and will split the packages to the right size.
