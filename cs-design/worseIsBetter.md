# Worse is better

Good software is simple, correct, consistent and complete.
However there are always tradeoffs when covering these aspects.
Software designer have been discussising these trade offs for as long as I can find.

The concept [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) argues that simplicity is more important then correctnes and completeness is the least important aspect.
Completeness is never fully archived anyway and a correct System is useless if nobody can use it.
Linux/Unix or [Bitcoin](https://www.gwern.net/Bitcoin-is-Worse-is-Better)  show that this is the right way.

The concept also states that it is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface.
While this is true for open-source software I don't see that aspect as relevant when developing code nobody will look at anyway.
